A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

---

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Refresher works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:refresher/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.

## Notes
Meetup Wednesday


KickOff
‚Å†‚ÄØSo @Miller Adulu  would you consider this project small? I just want to see like how do you gauge a project. Since multiple people were contributing it felt quite big-medium sized to me.

Also depending on the answer you choose from above would you follow the MVC you mentioned or stick to this?

Today‚Äôs Scope
- Token Security

Knowing Flutter !== Knowing Mobile Development

Extras
- HTTP Certificate Pinning
- 

1: Set the token to expire after a set time so that a log-in is forced
Useful for:
- Where tight security isn‚Äôt required
- Users de-activated elsewhere so when they are de-activated, they shouldn‚Äôt be able to access the app since the token is long living (Example: User deactivated on Google Admin, so their login won‚Äôt work, but they may have a valid token from the backend where the backend prefers to issue long-lasting tokens)
- 


Steps
- Log in
- Go on the landing page
- Open the debrief page

2: Refresh token
Useful for:
- Access Token
- Refresh
- More security-conscious APIs where instead of a user being forced to log back in to maintain the experience, they get two tokens, access token and a refresh token. 
- The access token is the token used to make the calls, then when it expires in the middle of a transaction to the target API, it‚Äôs refreshed and the request retried so that it doesn‚Äôt break the user flow


- Call login endpoint (Username & Password)
- Receive Access Token (To call the APIs) & Receive the Refresh Token (Longer lifespan)
- Call your APIs normally, 
- At some point, the token expires (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 request -> Token expired, refresh, then make next request)
- At this point, you use your refresh token, to call an endpoint that will give you a new access token
- Use the new token to make the request

Steps: (feature/setup-refresh-token)
- Disable hive is logged out: lib/services/hive_service.dart
- Enable error interceptor: lib/utils/network.dart
- Enable dummy token expiration: lib/services/debrief_service.dart
NB: Won‚Äôt need the error handlers for 401 in the individual methods

3: Auto log out
Useful for:
- Banks apps where you need to have the device request you to get signed out first
- So banks are security sensitive
- Slightly tedious to set-up, was unable to cover this in the sample app on time

Process
- Wrap  the app with Overlay (Portal) 
- Have a ticker to manage the time
- When the time expires, use the overlay portal to show the prompt
- Use Flutter to force an app restart, once it fails the check, then you have to log in again manually
